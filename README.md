# Whitespace Interpreter and "Whitespace Assembly" compiler

A project I made because I was bored.

My Python program follows Whitespace v0.3, as described on the [Esolangs Wiki](https://esolangs.org/wiki/Whitespace).

The programs have only been tested with macOS 15.3.2 and Python 3.12.9. If there are issues with running on other platforms, please let me know, preferrably by opening an issue.

Additionally, there may be bugs, particularly in the `whitespace` program. Please open an issue for these as well.

TO-DO list:

- Make labels more efficient
